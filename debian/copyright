The source of the Debian package was managed through CVS.  It was publically
available at <http://cvs.debian.org/userdir-ldap/?cvsroot=debian-admin>.

It is now managed using bzr and is publically available at
<http://db.debian.org/bzr/userdir-ldap/trunk>.


Since 2007 there are branches of userdir-ldap on bzr.debian.org, used by
various Debian-related projects to coordinate their own userdir-ldap
development as close as possible with that of Debian. The main branch is
available at <http://bzr.debian.org/da-tools/da-tools/userdir-ldap-common/>.
