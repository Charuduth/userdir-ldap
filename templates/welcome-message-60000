Dear __REALNAME__!

An account has been created for you on the Debian machine cluster. You can
use this account to help make software run properly on the Debian GNU/Linux
distribution. The username for this account is '__LOGIN__'. The password can
be found encrypted with your PGP key and appended to this message.

The following machines are accesible:
  faure.debian.org    Alpha running unstable
  albert.debian.org   Alpha running stable  [slow]
  kubrick.dbian.org   Sparc running unstable
  debussy.debian.org  ARM running unstable

Requests for Debian software to be installed should be directed at
debian-admin@lists.debian.org. Please note that not all software is available
on all architectures.

You should use ssh to log into the machines instead of regular telnet or 
rlogin.  We have installed ~/.ssh directories and empty authorized_keys
files with appropriate permissions on each machine.If you want to ssh to them
without typing the password, run ssh-keygen on your machine and add the 
contents of ~/.ssh/identity.pub into the authorized_keys files in ~/.ssh. But 
please be aware of the security implications of doing this.

After a short while of inactivity this account will be expired.
