Dear __REALNAME__!

An account has been created for you on the Debian machine cluster. You can
use this account to help make software run properly on the Debian GNU/Linux
distribution. The username for this account is '__LOGIN__'. The password can
be found encrypted with your PGP key and appended to this message.

See <URL:http://db.debian.org/machines.cgi> for a list of machines that are
available. The ones marked 'public' are available to non-developers.

Requests for Debian software to be installed should be directed at
debian-admin@lists.debian.org. Please note that not all software is available
on all architectures.

You should use ssh to log into the machines instead of regular telnet
or rlogin. Our LDAP directory is able to share ssh RSA keys among machines,
please see <URL:http://db.debian.org/doc-mail.html> Otherwise when you
first login a ~/.ssh directory will be created with the appropriate
permissions. Please be aware of the security implications of using RSA
authentication and ssh agents.

After a short while of inactivity this account will be expired. This account
is only to be used to help porting/improving free software.
