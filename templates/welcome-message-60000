Dear __REALNAME__!

An account has been created for you on the Debian machine cluster. You can
use this account to help make software run properly on the Debian GNU/Linux
distribution. The username for this account is '__LOGIN__'. The password can
be found encrypted with your PGP key and appended to this message.

See <URL:http://db.debian.org/machines.cgi> for a list of machines that are
available. The ones marked 'public' are available to non-developers.

Requests for Debian software to be installed on the machines (either
in the host system or a chroot environment) should be directed at
debian-admin@lists.debian.org.  Please note that not all software is
available on all architectures.  The chroot environments can be
entered with the 'dchroot' command.

You should use ssh to log into the machines. See the host details on
db.debian.org already mentioned above for the ssh hostkey fingerprints for the
servers you access. Our LDAP directory is able to share ssh RSA keys among
machines, please see <URL:http://db.debian.org/doc-mail.html>. Please be aware
of the security implications of using RSA authentication and ssh agents.

After a short while of inactivity this account will be expired. This account
is only to be used to help porting/improving free software.

Please note while technically there is a __LOGIN__@debian.org address
associated with this account we very much expect you to not use it.  Thanks.
