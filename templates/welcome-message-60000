Dear __REALNAME__!

An account has been created for you on the Debian machine cluster. You can
use this account to help make software run properly on the Debian
distribution. The username for this account is '__LOGIN__'.

See <URL:https://db.debian.org/machines.cgi> for a list of machines that are
available.  The list of which machines you can access is user-dependent.
To find out which machines you have access to try running
    ldapsearch -LLL -b dc=debian,dc=org -x -h db.debian.org \
        uid=__LOGIN__ allowedHost

On porter machines, the chroot environments can be entered with the
'schroot' command, depending on setup; take a look at the list of
machines to know which are our porterboxes.  You can install build
dependencies yourself once you instantiated a session.  Please
consult <URL:https://dsa.debian.org/doc/schroot/> for more information
and ask your mentors if you need any help.

You should use ssh to log into the machines. See the host details on
db.debian.org for the ssh hostkey fingerprints for the servers you
access.  Our LDAP directory is able to share ssh RSA keys among
machines, please see <URL:https://db.debian.org/doc-mail.html> for
general documentation and for how to add ssh keys to the LDAP. Please be
aware of the security implications of using RSA authentication and ssh
agents.

Your password to access db.debian.org can be found encrypted with your
PGP key and appended to this message.  It cannot be used to log into
our machines; see the paragraph on SSH keys above.

After a short while this account will be expired, please contact DSA
if you need it for longer or wish to re-activate your account once
expired. This account is only to be used to help porting/improving free
software.

Please note while technically there might be __LOGIN__@debian.org address
associated with this account we very much expect you to not use it.  Thanks.
