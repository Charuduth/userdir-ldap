  carefully. ]

Dear __REALNAME__!

Your account '__LOGIN__' has just been created in the central LDAP
database of the Debian project.  Please note that it needs a bit of time
until this information is synced with all developer-accessible machines.
You should be able to login or upload packages after about 30-60 minutes.
The password for this account can be found appended to this message,
encrypted with your GPG key.
Email sent to <__LOGIN__@debian.org> will be forwarded to <__EMAIL__>,
to change this visit <URL:http://db.debian.org/forward.html>.

You now have access to various project machines, for a list of them take
a look at <URL:http://db.debian.org/machines.cgi>.
Please remember that you accepted the Debian Machine Usage Policy in
your NM process (available at <URL:http://www.debian.org/devel/dmup>).

If you need additional software installed on one of the machines (either
in the host system or a chroot environment) please contact
debian-admin@lists.debian.org, but keep in mind that not all software is
available on all architectures.  The chroot environments can be
entered with the 'dchroot' command; take a look at the list of machines
to know which one has chroots available for you.

You need to use ssh to log into the machines; telnet and rlogin are
disabled for security reasons.  The LDAP directory is able to share RSA
ssh keys among machines, please see <URL:http://db.debian.org/doc-mail.html>
Please be aware of the security implications of using RSA authentication
and ssh agents.

To give you a quick overview here is a list of the most important
machines from the project you can access.  First there is
ftp-master.debian.org, it is our main archive server and the place
where you upload your packages.  It is restricted, so you can only
upload with anonymous FTP - a tool like dput or dupload can aid this
process.  The Projects CVS archive, the main shell server and various
other stuff is located on gluck.debian.org.  This machine is also
reachable as {cvs,people}.debian.org.  If you want your own Debian
related site to appear behind <URL:http://people.debian.org/~__LOGIN__>
then put it at this machine in the directory ~/public_html/.

The machine hosting most of our VCS repositories
({svn,bzr,git,arch,hg}.debian.org) is alioth.debian.org. It's handled
by a separate team (admin@alioth.debian.org) as it allows login by
non-Debian developers. You probably already have a *-guest account
there.  Please refer to http://wiki.debian.org/AliothFAQ to learn
anything you need to know, including how to activate your account and
how to request the removal of your old -guest account.

There is one developer-only mailing list, debian-private.  You have been
subscribed to this list as <__PRIVATE__>, please respect the privacy of
this list and don't forward mail from it elsewhere.  This subscription, and
a lot of other data like your private information, can be changed at the
web interface available behind <URL:https://db.debian.org/>; just login
with the password information appended to this email.

The information stored here is used to maintain your accounts on various
Debian machines, and also to allow other developers and general users to
find out more about you.  Many of the fields are only visible to other
registered Debian developers.  This is also the only way to change your
password.  The passwd program does not yet work.

Before we go on with other important information let's remember the most
important documents from the NM process.  That you now got your account
doesn't mean to stop reading and checking them whenever you do packaging
or other Debian related work.

  o The Debian Social Contract
    <URL:http://www.debian.org/social_contract.html>

  o The Debian Policy Manual
    <URL:http://www.debian.org/doc/debian-policy/>

  o The Debian Developer's reference
    <URL:http://www.debian.org/doc/developers-reference/>

You can find much more information useful to developers at
<URL:http://www.debian.org/devel/>.

Also, please subscribe to the mailing list debian-devel-announce, if you
haven't done so already.  All Debian developers are required to read
this list, as important announcements are made there.

We strongly suggest that you use your __LOGIN__@debian.org address for
the maintainer field in your packages, because that one will be valid
as long as you are a Debian developer, even if you change jobs, leave
university or change Internet Service providers.  If you do so, please
add that address to your PGP/GPG key(s) (using `gpg --edit-key "YOUR
USER ID"') and send it to the keyring server at keyring.debian.org
with `gpg --keyserver keyring.debian.org --send-keys "YOUR USER ID"'.

We suggest that you subscribe to debian-mentors@lists.debian.org.
This list is for new maintainers who seek help with initial packaging
and other developer-related issues.  Those who prefer one-on-one help
can also post to the list, and an experienced developer may volunteer
to help you.  You can get online help on IRC, too, if you join the
channel #debian-devel or #debian-mentors on irc.debian.org.  Take a look
at the support section on <URL:http://www.debian.org/> in order to find
out more information.

If you have some spare time and want to contribute it to Debian you
may wish to take a look at the "Work-Needing and Prospective Packages",
(WNPP) that can be found at <URL:http://www.debian.org/devel/wnpp/>.

Welcome to the project!
