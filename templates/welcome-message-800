   important information, please read it all carefully. ]

Dear __REALNAME__!

An account has been created for you on developer-accessible machines
with username '__LOGIN__'.  The password for this account can be found 
encrypted with your PGP or GPG key and appended to this message. A list 
of machines available to Debian developers can be found at
<URL:http://db.debian.org/machines.cgi>. Please take a minute now to
familiarize yourself with the Debian Machine Usage Policy, available
at <URL:http://www.debian.org/devel/dmup>

You have been subscribed to the debian-private mailing list as
<__PRIVATE__> (you should receive seperate confirmation of this from
smartlist).  Please respect the privacy of that list and don't forward
mail from it elsewhere.  E-mail to <__LOGIN__@debian.org> will be
forwarded to <__EMAIL__>.  To change this, edit the file '.qmail' in
your home directory on master to point to the new address (don't
forget the '&' character at the beginning of the line). Also, please 
subscribe to debian-devel-announce, if you haven't done so already.

We strongly suggest that you use your __LOGIN__@debian.org address for
the maintainer field in your packages, because that one will be valid
as long as you are a Debian developer, even if you change jobs, leave
university or change Internet Service providers.  If you do so, please 
add that address to your PGP/GPG key(s) (using `gpg --edit-key 
"YOUR USER ID"') and send it to <keyring-maint@debian.org>.

You can find more information useful to developers at
<URL:http://www.debian.org/devel/> (in particular, see the subsection
titled "Debian Developer's reference"). 

We suggest that you subscribe to debian-mentors@lists.debian.org.
This list is for new maintainers who seek help with initial packaging
and other developer-related issues.  Those who prefer one-on-one help
can also post to the list, and an experienced developer may volunteer
to help you.  You can get online help on IRC, too, if you join the
channel #debian-devel on irc.debian.org.  Take a look at the support
section on www.debian.org in order to find out more information.

You should have read these documents before working on your packages.

  o The Debian Social Contract
    <URL:http://www.debian.org/social_contract.html>

  o The Debian Policy Manual
    <URL:http://www.debian.org/doc/debian-policy/>

  o The Debian Packaging Manual
    <URL:http://www.debian.org/doc/packaging-manuals/packaging.html>

If you have some spare time and want to contribute it to Debian you
may wish to take a look at the "Work-Needing and Prospective Packages
for Debian GNU/Linux" also known as WNPP that can be found at
<URL:http://ftp.debian.org/debian/doc/package-developer/prospective-packages.html>

If you plan to make a Debian package from a not yet packaged piece of
software you *must* announce your intention on the debian-devel mailing
list to make sure nobody else is working on them.

The machine master.debian.org is our main archive 
server.  Every uploaded package finds it's way there (except for Packages 
covered by US crypto laws which go to non-us.debian.org) eventually. That
machine is also the home of our bug tracking system. Project web
pages and CVS archives are hosted on va.debian.org (aka cvs/www.debian.org).

You should use ssh to log into the machines instead of regular telnet
or rlogin. Our LDAP directory is able to share ssh RSA keys among machines,
please see <URL:http://db.debian.org/doc-mail.html> Otherwise when you
first login a ~/.ssh directory will be created with the appropriate
permissions. Please be aware of the security implications of using RSA
authentication and ssh agents.

Finally, please take a minute to visit <URL:http://db.debian.org/>. 
Login using the password information appended to this email, and 
update your personal information. The information is used to maintain 
your accounts on various Debian machines, and also to allow other 
developers and general users to find out more about you. Many of 
the fields are only visible to other registered Debian developers. This
is also the only way to change your password. The passwd program does not 
yet work.

Welcome to the project!
