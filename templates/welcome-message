Dear __REALNAME__!

An account has been created for you on the debian.org infrastructure
with username '__LOGIN__'.

For some reason you are getting this generic welcome message instead
of one with information more relevant to your specific account details.
Please let DSA know of this and maybe they can help figure out why
that is.
