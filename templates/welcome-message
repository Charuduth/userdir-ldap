   important information, please read it all carefully. ]

Dear __REALNAME__!

An account has been created for you on master.debian.org and
va.debian.org with username '__LOGIN__'.  The password for this
account can be found encrypted with your PGP key and appended to this
message.

You have been subscribed to the debian-private mailing list as
<__PRIVATE__> (you should receive seperate confirmation of this from
smartlist).  Please respect the privacy of that list and don't forward
mail from it elsewhere.  E-mail to <__LOGIN__@debian.org> will be
forwarded to <__EMAIL__>.  To change this, edit the file '.qmail' in
your home directory on master to point to the new address (don't
forget the '&' character at the beginning of the line).  Please
subscribe to debian-devel-announce, if you haven't done so already.

We strongly suggest that you use your __LOGIN__@debian.org address for
the maintainer field in your packages, because that one will be valid
as long as you are a Debian developer, even if you change jobs, leave
university or change Internet Service providers.  If you do so, please 
add that address to your PGP key (using `pgp -ke "YOUR USER ID"'), if
you have one, and your GnuPG key (using `gpg --edit-key "YOUR USER ID"')
and send it to <keyring-maint@debian.org>.

You can find more information useful to developers at
<URL:https://www.debian.org/devel/> (in particular, see the subsection
titled "Debian Developer's reference").

We suggest that you subscribe to debian-mentors@lists.debian.org.
This list is for new maintainers who seek help with initial packaging
and other developer-related issues.  Those who prefer one-on-one help
can also post to the list, and an experienced developer may volunteer
to help you.  You can get online help on IRC, too, if you join the
channel #debian-devel on irc.debian.org.  Take a look at the support
section on www.debian.org in order to find out more information.

You should have read these documents before working on your packages.

  o The Debian Social Contract
    <URL:https://www.debian.org/social_contract.html>

  o The Debian Policy Manual
    <URL:https://www.debian.org/doc/debian-policy/>

  o The Debian Packaging Manual
    <URL:https://www.debian.org/doc/packaging-manuals/packaging.html>

If you have some spare time and want to contribute it to Debian you
may wish to take a look at the "Work-Needing and Prospective Packages
for Debian GNU/Linux" also known as WNPP that can be found at
<URL:ftp://ftp.debian.org/doc/package-developer/prospective-packages.html>

If you plan to make a Debian package from a not yet packaged piece of
software you *must* announce your intention on the debian-devel mailing
list to make sure nobody else is working on them.

The machine master.debian.org is our main archive server.  Every
uploaded package finds it's way there (except for Packages covered by
US crypto laws which go to non-us.debian.org) eventually.  That
machine is also the home of our web pages and our bug tracking system.
The second machine va.debian.org is supposed to take over some of the
work master does.

Both machines were sponsored by companies (Novare Inc. for master and
VA Linux Systems for va).  Please don't over-stress them and use your
accounts carefully.

You should use ssh to log into the machines instead of regular telnet
or rlogin.  We have installed ~/.ssh directories and authorized_keys
files with appropriate permissions on both machines.  If you want to
ssh to them without typing the password, run ssh-keygen on your
machine and add the contents of ~/.ssh/identity.pub into the
authorized_keys files in ~/.ssh on master and va.  But please be aware
of the security implications of doing this.

Welcome to the project!
