# Imports passwd, shadow and group files into the directory.
# You should cleanse the files of anything you do not want to add to the
# directory.
#
# The first step is to call this script to import the passwd file and
# create all the new entries. This should be done on an empty freshly 
# initialized directory with the rootdn/password set in the server.
# The command to execute is
#   ldapimport -a -p ~/passwd
# The -a tells the script to add all the entries it finds, it should be
# used only once.
#
# The next step is to import the shadow file and group, no clensing need be 
# done for 
# this as any entries that do not exist will be ignored (silently)
#  ldapimport -s /etc/shadow -g /etc/group
#
